CheckPt
=======
CheckPt (tentative title) is an experiment in building a full-stack JavaScript
application. It will essentially be a glorified checklist for consumable media
(videos, movies, podcasts, books) and is more for my own personal use than
anything. CheckPt will allow you to check in files/media you intend to consume,
break them down into reasonable checkpoints (episodes, chapters) and track
your progress throughout.

Why not just use a to-do list you ask? Because a to-do list doesn't teach me
node.js, and my RememberTheMilk account already has enough stuff I'll never get
around to as it is.

Dependencies
------------
Check the packages.json file. It should be pretty complete. You'll need *npm*
and *jake* to get things bootstrapped, however.

Building
--------
I plan on adding more Jake tasks to download and install deps, etc. Not going
to worry about it yet.
